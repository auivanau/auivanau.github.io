> **Note:** I took a long break from this project while on my General Surgery rotation—life in the wards has been nonstop! But now I’m back with fresh eyes (and tired feet) to pick the perfect printer for my skull phantom.

## 🏆 Printer Must-Haves

To print my **Enhanced Anthropomorphic Phantom** (skull + sinuses + eyes) with the chosen materials, the printer had to:

1. **Handle abrasive filaments** (Proto-Pasta Stainless Steel PLA → hardened-steel nozzle)  
2. **Print transparent PETG** cleanly (direct-drive extruder preferred)  
3. **Fit a build volume** of at least 220 × 220 × 270 mm  
4. **Stay under CAD \$1 000** (so I can invest in materials and upgrades)

## 🔍 Candidates Evaluated

| Printer               | Volume (mm)      | Direct-Drive | Hardened-Nozzle Ready | Approx. Price (CAD) | Notes                         |
|-----------------------|------------------|--------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Creality Ender 3 V3** | 220×220×270      | Yes          | Yes                   | \$600–\$700         | ABL, silent drivers, affordable |
| Anycubic Vyper        | 245×245×260      | No*          | Yes                   | \$500               | Auto-level; Bowden extruder  |
| Artillery Sidewinder X1| 300×300×400     | Yes          | Yes                   | \$500               | Large build; rapid heat-bed   |

_* Bowden extruders can print PETG but may string more._

## 🎯 Final Decision: Ender 3 V3

**Why it won:**

- **Direct-drive extruder** for PETG clarity  
- **Hardened-steel nozzle** compatibility out of the box  
- **Auto-bed leveling (ABL)** to reduce busy-ward calibration time  
- **Silent stepper drivers** (my on-call teammates will thank me!)  
- Fits my **220 × 220 × 270 mm** skull halves exactly  
- Leaves budget for essential upgrades (nozzle, enclosure)

## 🔧 Next Steps

1. **Order the Ender 3 V3** (and hardened nozzle upgrade).  
2. **Set up** in my home workspace with enclosure and fume filter.  
3. **Run first calibration prints** with Stainless-PLA and PETG cubes before tackling skull slices.  

Coming up: **“Phase 2 Prototype Results”**—I’ll share my first prints from EPL and then on the new Ender 3 V3 once it arrives. Stay tuned!
