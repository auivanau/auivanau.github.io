title: "3. Defining the MVP: A Rapid PLA Skull Prototype"

After juggling rotations in General Surgery and deep dives into materials research, market surveys, and printer specs, it became clear that my original visionâ€”a multi-material skull with sinuses and PETG eyesâ€”was too ambitious for the short term. I needed a streamlined MVP I could complete in weeks, not months.

## ðŸŽ¯ Pivot to a Short-Term Goal

**New MVP**:  
- **Single-material PLA skull** (no sinuses or eyes)  
- **Use local 3D resources** (e.g., Edmonton Public Library Makerspace)  
- **Focus**: Test core segmentation â†’ printability â†’ dimensional accuracy

This prototype will let me:
1. **Validate my CT â†’ STL workflow** end-to-end  
2. **Trial mesh repairs and slicing** without material complications  
3. **Produce a tangible result** with the hope to have a physical prototype completed before the end of the year

## ðŸ›  Why This Makes Sense

- **Simplicity:** PLA prints fast, slices reliably, and requires no hardened nozzle.  
- **Accessibility:** EPLâ€™s service charges \$0.10/g and has overnight turnaroundâ€”perfect for quick iterations.  
- **Feedback Loop:** I can adjust mesh settings or scale within days, rather than weeks.

## ðŸ”œ Next Posts Will Cover

- **Uploading & preparing** the skull STL for EPL submission  
- **First print results**: photos, filament weight, warping observations  
- **Mesh vs. solid tweaks**: what needed fixing post-print  
- **Roadmap to re-add sinuses & eyes** now that the core skull works

Stay tunedâ€”this rapid PLA prototype will set the foundation for everything that follows!
