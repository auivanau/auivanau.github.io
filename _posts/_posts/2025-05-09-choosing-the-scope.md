title: "Choosing the Scope: Skull, Eyes & Sinuses"

When I started brainstorming this project, I knew I wanted to bridge two parts of my life: my **background in materials engineering**, and my **current path in medicine**. I missed the technical challenges from my engineering career, and saw an opportunity to bring that mindset into something clinically useful ‚Äî particularly for radiation oncology, radiology, and education.

But the first challenge was obvious: **what exactly should I build?**

### üß† Structuring the Problem

Rather than choosing arbitrarily, I took a structured approach. I created a **decision matrix** to weigh the pros and cons of different anatomical phantom options. I evaluated four escalating levels of complexity:

- **Option A**: Skull only  
- **Option B**: Skull with Sinuses  
- **Option C**: Skull with Sinuses and Eyes  
- **Option D**: Skull with Sinuses, Eyes, and Basic Facial Features

I scored each one across several weighted criteria:
- Anatomical Accuracy
- Distinctiveness
- Feasibility (for 3D printing within my timeline)
- Clinical Relevance
- Educational Value
- Presentation Impact
- Resource Requirements

Each criterion was weighted based on what I personally valued for this project, and each option was rated from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) per criterion. You can [view the full decision matrix here](#) *(link coming soon)*.

### üèÜ The Winner: Option C

While Option D scored the highest overall, it came with higher complexity and risk. **Option C ‚Äî Skull with Sinuses and Eyes ‚Äî emerged as the best balance** between realism, clinical relevance, visual impact, and print feasibility.

- The **skull** provides a recognizable structure with bone density mimicking
- The **sinuses** allow for accurate air gaps to test radiological behavior
- The **eyes**, printed in transparent PETG, offer soft-tissue simulation and enhance educational use

### üéØ Why This Scope Works

This setup is:
- **Visually distinct**: easy to recognize from across a room
- **Clinically relevant**: skull, orbits, and sinuses are common RT targets
- **Printable**: fits within a single build volume on an FDM printer
- **Scalable**: allows future iterations (e.g. facial features, dosimeters)

It also leaves room to experiment with materials, validate CT behavior, and eventually integrate with clinical QA workflows ‚Äî without being so complex that I can‚Äôt finish it by October.

Next up: I‚Äôll review what‚Äôs already out there in the phantom world ‚Äî and how my design fits in.
