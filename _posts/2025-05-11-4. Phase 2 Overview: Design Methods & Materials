So far in Phase 2 I’ve been establishing my **workflow** and exploring **early prototypes**.  

---

## 1. CT → 3D Model Pipeline

1. **Download CT** from the Visible Human Project (Harvard Dataverse) via a custom Python DICOM downloader.  
2. **Segment bone** in InVesalius 3 using a threshold of **236–2875 HU**.  
3. **Generate surface** and export as an STL for printing.

### 2. Mesh Cleanup & Prototyping  

#### Prototype 1 (May 7, 2025)  
- **Skipped** smoothing/hole-fill (Meshmixer) and advanced mods (Fusion/Blender).  
- **Sliced** directly in PrusaSlicer:  
  ![Prototype 1 in PrusaSlicer showing oversized and over-detailed mesh](/assets/prototype1-prusaslicer.png)  
  - **Issues**:  
    1. Model too large (cut off at the build-plate limits)  
    2. Mesh too fine for 0.4 mm nozzle → thousands of unprintable facets  
    3. No stable base (floating vertebrae) → massive supports required  

#### Prototype 2 (Mid-May)  
- Added **Meshmixer smoothing** & hole-filling.  
- Tried additional **Fusion 360** mods before slicing again.  
- **Results** (rotated halves, fewer errors):  
  ![Prototype 2 cleaned and split halves](/assets/prototype2-cleaned.png)  
- **Remaining challenge**: excessive internal “junk” geometry and non-manifold fragments  

### 3. Next Steps in Phase 2  
1. **Automated repair**: use Meshmixer’s Inspector on a decimated mesh (50–80 % reduction).  
2. **Manual cleanup**: export only the outer shell via Separate Shells (or Make Solid → Separate Shells).  
3. **Plane cut** along a surgical plane (parallel to the mandible) for printable halves.  
4. **Test print** at EPL with PLA.  
5. **Measure** dimensional accuracy and log filament usage.

> 📂 **Uploading figures**  
> 1. Export each screenshot from your PDF (right-click → “Save as…” in your PDF viewer).  
> 2. In GitHub: **Add file → Upload files** into an `/assets` folder at the repo root.  
> 3. Reference them in markdown as:  
>    ```md
>    ![Alt text](/assets/your-filename.png)
>    ```  
> You don’t need Imgur or external hosting—GitHub Pages will serve these images directly.

Stay tuned for **Prototype 3 Results**, where I’ll share my first PLA‐printed skull halves and CT validation data!
