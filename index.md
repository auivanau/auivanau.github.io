      <p class="home-hero-body">
        Welcome to my digital lab — a space shaped by curiosity and experimentation.
        This is where I prototype concepts, stress-test workflows, play with AI tools,
        and break down complex problems the same way you’d approach an experiment:
        build something, test it, learn from it, iterate.
      </p>

      <p class="home-hero-body">
        Some posts are structured deep dives. Others are half-finished experiments,
        long-form notes, or ideas in progress. The goal isn’t perfection — it’s
        discovery. If you’re interested in AI, creative problem-solving, or how
        hands-on experimentation can shape clinical thinking, you’ll feel at home here.
