### Welcome

I'm Ivan Au — a medical student with a background in materials engineering and a long-standing interest in emerging technologies. Early in my career, I was lucky enough to do a short research internship in nanomaterials in Germany. After returning to Canada, I spent several years working in Alberta’s energy sector, including roles in the oil sands and pipeline systems. That experience gave me a ground-level view of industrial health, safety systems, and environmental risk — and continues to inform my current work in medicine and public health.
This blog is a digital lab notebook for my independent projects at the intersection of **engineering**, **medicine**, and **population health**. I use it to document workflows, share design ideas, and reflect on the technical and societal questions I’m exploring.

Welcome to the lab — Thanks for stopping by.
