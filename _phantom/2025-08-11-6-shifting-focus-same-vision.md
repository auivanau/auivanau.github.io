Many things have happened since I last looked at this project. It’s been almost three months now, and I’ve been pretty busy in between my OBGYN rotation and some elective rotations — including radiation oncology itself. With a better sense of the clinical day-to-day work that radiation oncologists do, and how this project could have more clinical relevance, I still believe it’s useful. However, I’m now considering a slight shift toward something more med-ed focused, like printing slices of CT scans for contouring visualization, or it could be used for a broader audience, e.g. first year med students trying to learn radioanatomy and connect it to something physically 3D.  

That said, the technical issues still remain. The floating debris, discontinuities, and mesh artifacts are still a problem — and I know those won’t translate well onto the 3D printer.  

Another interesting realization was around **file management**. I’ve been trying to keep everything organized with numbering systems in neatly sorted folders, but I’ve found that when I take a long break from the project, I lose track of exactly where I left off. Fortunately, with the help of GPT and this blog, I’ve been able to keep a clear record of my steps. It’s been surprisingly effective as a project management tool.  

Lastly, I reached out to a former mentor and engineering professor to get their opinion and they are actually working on something quite similar now which is exciting. They mentioned they’ve worked on somewhat similar projects involving CT images and 3D printing. The software they used is called "Materialise Mimics Core", and use stratasys digital anatomy printer. Unfortunately for me, the Materialise Mimics Core is certainly not a free product. I'll request a free trial, and in the meantime see if I can print this as low cost as possible.
