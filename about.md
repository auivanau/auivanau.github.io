# About Me

Hi, I’m Ivan.

I’m a medical student at the University of Alberta with a background in materials engineering (P.Eng) and a long-standing interest in emerging technologies. Before medicine, I worked in nanomaterials research and in Alberta’s energy sector in roles focused on oil sands operations and pipeline integrity. That mix of research and applied engineering shaped how I think about systems, design, and problem-solving.

This site is where I keep a running record of projects at the intersection of medicine, engineering, design, and AI. Most of what appears here are experiments: workflows, prototypes, models, and technical notes that reflect whatever I’m currently learning or building.

Outside of work and school, I play drums, lift, and occasionally climb things.

Thanks for stopping by.
