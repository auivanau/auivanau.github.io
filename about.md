# About Me

Hi, I’m Ivan.

I’m currently a medical student at the University of Alberta, with a background in materials engineering (P.Eng).
This blog documents my independent projects that sit at the intersection of engineering and clinical care. I also like to play drums, lift, and sometimes climb things.

Thanks for stopping by.
