# Occupational & Environmental Health Near Mildred Lake Oil Sands

This is an independent scholarly project that investigates population-level occupational and environmental health concerns in the Wood Buffalo region of Alberta, Canada.

It integrates the following data sources:
- Workers’ Compensation Board (WCB) injury claims
- Air pollution metrics (e.g. PM2.5, NO₂, SO₂)
- Demographic data from Statistics Canada

**Goals of the project:**
- Identify temporal and geographic patterns of environmental exposure
- Analyze injury trends relative to pollutant levels and weather
- Understand demographic disparities (including Indigenous populations and fly-in/fly-out workers)

_This work aligns with my broader interests in public health, environmental medicine, and interdisciplinary data science._
