# Occupational & Environmental Health Near Mildred Lake Oil Sands

In my previous career as a materials engineer, my first "real" job I got out of undergrad was to return back to my home city in Fort Mac. To work where I grew up, to work where my dad had worked for 23 years straight without taking a sick day (this detail he loved to brag about). I remember the first time on the diversified coach buses riding north to land of grade-AAA Alberta-born-and-bred gold (oil sands). Bumpy, sleepy, ride. I wake up 5 minutes from the end and I see a desert where there used to be a forest. Truly barren, and then, off in the distance, getting larger, is a plume of vapor, and a huge bucket excavator.
As I was standing in that parking lot outside, watching employees march towards 41B, I took a breath, of not-so-fresh air. This air had gone through a lot, it was beat up and roughed up. My olfactory bulbs conducted these memories deep in to my hppocampus. I've always been a bit of a systems thinker. If you want big change, you gotta see things farther out. So I thought maybe this could be an intersting field that not a lot of people are looking in to? Is there some connection between the air quality and places like oil sands and getting sick?

This is an independent scholarly project that investigates population-level occupational and environmental health concerns in the Wood Buffalo region of Alberta, Canada.

It integrates the following data sources:
- Workers’ Compensation Board (WCB) injury claims
- Air pollution metrics (e.g. PM2.5, NO₂, SO₂)
- Demographic data from Statistics Canada

**Goals of the project:**
- Identify temporal and geographic patterns of environmental exposure
- Analyze injury trends relative to pollutant levels and weather
- Understand demographic disparities (including Indigenous populations and fly-in/fly-out workers)

- Let's add a little scientific rigor to this:
P (Population): Workers employed in the Alberta oil sands industry (e.g., Syncrude, Mildred Lake) from 2005 to 2024
I (Intervention/Exposure): Occupational exposure to oil sands emissions (e.g., SO₂, PM₂.₅, VOCs)
C (Comparison): General Alberta workforce or workers in other non-oil-sands heavy industry sectors
O (Outcome): Prevalence or incidence of WCB-accepted respiratory illness claims (e.g., asthma, chronic bronchitis, COPD)
