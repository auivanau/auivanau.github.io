# Wait Times from Lumpectomy to Adjuvant Radiotherapy in Canada (Focus: Alberta & British Columbia)

## Executive Summary

Breast cancer patients who undergo breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) typically require adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) to eradicate residual cancer cells and reduce recurrence. Timely initiation of post-lumpectomy RT is critical for optimal outcomes. Clinical guidelines in Canada and internationally recommend starting RT as soon as the surgical site heals – ideally within 4–12 weeks after surgery. Delays beyond 12 weeks are associated with higher local recurrence rates, and extreme delays (>20 weeks) can adversely impact survival. To ensure timely care, Canada established system performance benchmarks: for example, the pan-Canadian target is that 90% of patients start RT within 28 days of being ready to treat (i.e. post-consultation and planning). Alberta and British Columbia historically met these 4-week RT benchmarks; however, recent system pressures (exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce shortages) have lengthened waits in some regions.

Guidelines & Evidence: Canadian cancer agencies (and international bodies like NCCN, ASTRO, and NICE) have long set targets for timely post-surgery RT. A Canadian national guideline recommends starting breast irradiation no later than 12 weeks after lumpectomy (if no chemotherapy is needed). Many experts consider 8 weeks a more ideal upper limit, and some European programs aim for ~5–6 weeks. If chemotherapy is part of treatment, RT naturally commences later – often 5–7 months post-surgery – and evidence suggests that postponing RT until chemo is finished does not increase local recurrence risk in that context. Table 1 compares key guideline targets. Clinical studies link prolonged RT wait times with worse outcomes: delays >8–12 weeks can increase local recurrence, and one large Canadian study found that starting RT >20 weeks after surgery significantly worsened relapse-free and overall survival. On the other hand, starting RT extremely early (e.g. <4 weeks) has not shown additional benefit, indicating a reasonable window exists for post-operative healing and oncologic planning. The evidence underscores that meeting recommended wait-time windows (within 8–12 weeks post-lumpectomy) is important to avoid compromising cancer control.

Real-World Wait Times (Canada, AB vs. BC): In practice, most Canadian provinces have historically delivered timely breast RT, but recent data reveal regional challenges, especially in British Columbia. Prior to 2020, nearly all Canadian patients (>95–98%) began RT within 4 weeks of ready-to-treat date. In Alberta, a major expansion of RT capacity through new regional cancer centres resulted in 98% of patients starting RT within 4 weeks of readiness by 2020 (with 64% starting within just 2 weeks). Even before that expansion, Alberta met targets: in 2009 about 85% of patients began RT within 4.5 weeks of readiness (and the remaining ~15% by 8 weeks). However, Alberta’s current waits have lengthened upstream in the pathway – notably, the consultation backlog. As of 2023–24, patients at the Cross Cancer Institute (Edmonton) and Tom Baker Cancer Centre (Calgary) often wait 12–13 weeks just for a radiation oncology consult, far exceeding the province’s 4-week referral-to-consult benchmark. These consult delays mean some lumpectomy patients are starting RT 16–17 weeks post-surgery, well beyond guideline ideals. Alberta’s oncology leadership attributes this to strained workforce capacity: the number of oncologists grew only 20% from 2013 to 2022 while new cancer cases rose ~40%, leading to dangerous overload. Indeed, Alberta’s cancer centres are “overcapacity and under-resourced,” with specialist shortages and physical space limitations (Edmonton’s Cross Cancer Institute is at capacity). Despite these challenges, Alberta’s internal data suggests that once a patient is “ready to treat,” RT is still initiated quickly – the delay is primarily in getting to that point. In fact, Alberta reportedly continues to treat most patients within 4 weeks of the ready-date (maintaining the CIHI benchmark). The gap is that “surgery-to-RT-start” intervals are not publicly tracked, and the long consult waits prolong the overall timeline unmeasured by public dashboards. This indicates a system-level blind spot: official stats can look acceptable (focus on ready-to-treatment wait), even as patients experience lengthy waits from surgery to consultation to therapy start.

British Columbia’s wait-time challenges became a national concern post-pandemic. BC’s centralized BC Cancer agency, which serves the entire province, saw deteriorating RT wait times in 2022–2023 due to rising demand and staffing shortfalls. At one Interior BC hospital (Vernon Jubilee), a QI study documented that the average wait from referral to RT start grew from 78 days in 2013 to 106 days in 2023, with most intervals (imaging-to-diagnosis, surgery booking, oncology consults) significantly slower in 2023 than a decade prior. By spring 2023, only ~69% of BC patients started RT within 4 weeks of readiness – meaning nearly one-third waited longer than the 28-day benchmark. Some breast cancer patients were waiting well beyond 8–12 weeks post-surgery for adjuvant RT, prompting BC Cancer to take the extraordinary step of outsourcing treatments to the U.S. in May 2023. Over 1,100 BC patients were ultimately sent to Bellingham, WA for timely radiation in 2023. This crisis spurred an infusion of resources: BC’s government launched a 10-Year Cancer Action Plan, hiring 71 more oncologists and 32 radiation therapists and expanding treatment capacity. By mid-2024, BC reported 76.1% of patients starting RT within 4 weeks, up from ~65% a year earlier. As of February 2025, performance has rebounded – 93% of BC patients began RT in <4 weeks, exceeding the 90% national benchmark. Figure 1 illustrates this sharp turnaround in BC’s RT wait-time performance. Alberta, in contrast, did not experience such a dramatic drop in RT treatment timeliness; its challenges remain more in access to consultation. Other provinces (e.g. Ontario, Quebec) maintained relatively high on-time RT rates throughout, consistently treating >90% within 28 days of ready-date. (Montreal’s academic hospitals, for example, met the 28-day target >90% of the time every year from 2012–2016.) Table 2 summarizes available wait-time data across jurisdictions, highlighting pre- vs. post-pandemic trends.

Fig. 1: British Columbia’s radiotherapy wait-time performance (% of patients starting RT within 28 days of ready-to-treat). A steep decline in 2022–2023 (down to ~69%) was reversed by 2025 after capacity investments.

## PART 1 – Clinical Context

Population & Outcome: The focus is on patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery (lumpectomy) who require post-operative radiotherapy. These are typically Stage I or II breast cancer patients for whom lumpectomy plus whole-breast radiation is the standard of care. The outcome of interest is the time interval from the date of lumpectomy surgery to the start of the first adjuvant radiation therapy fraction, measured in weeks. This “surgery-to-RT” wait encompasses surgical recovery, referral to an oncology centre, consultation with a radiation oncologist, radiotherapy planning (simulation and treatment planning), and the actual commencement of radiation treatments. Delays in this interval are concerning because prolonged waits could allow microscopic residual cancer cells to grow, potentially increasing the risk of local recurrence. Guideline recommendations (elaborated in Part 2) generally advise starting adjuvant RT within about 8–12 weeks post-surgery in order to maximize therapeutic benefit.

Geographic Focus – Alberta and British Columbia: These two provinces’ cancer care systems provide a useful contrast. Alberta delivers radiotherapy through Cancer Care Alberta (part of Alberta Health Services), with major centres in Edmonton (Cross Cancer Institute) and Calgary (Tom Baker Cancer Centre), plus regional centres in Lethbridge, Red Deer, Medicine Hat, and (since 2021) Grande Prairie. British Columbia provides cancer services through BC Cancer, a single provincial agency with six regional cancer centres (Vancouver, Victoria, Surrey, Abbotsford, Kelowna, Prince George) and upcoming new centres (Kamloops, Nanaimo, etc.). Both provinces track wait times internally, but public reporting differs (as discussed in Part 4). The motivation for this deep dive stems from anecdotal observations in Alberta: at Edmonton’s Cross Cancer Institute, multiple lumpectomy patients in 2023 had 16–17 week delays from surgery to first RT – roughly double the recommended timeframe. Such waits raise the question: are these isolated cases or indicative of a broader system-level trend? Could they be a temporary backlog artifact from the COVID-19 era, or do they signal chronic capacity issues? By examining guidelines, actual wait-time data, and system processes, we aim to understand whether these extended waits are outliers or part of a concerning pattern in Alberta (and compare to BC’s situation). Ultimately, this context sets the stage for quality improvement discussions if warranted.

## PART 2 – Guidelines & Targets for Timing of Adjuvant RT

Timely initiation of adjuvant radiotherapy has been emphasized in clinical guidelines for decades. Below is a summary of key guideline recommendations and targets (Canadian and international) regarding the interval from surgery to post-operative RT, as well as evidence on the impact of delays. Table 1 compares current and historical benchmarks.

Canadian Guidelines: Clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer (1998) – issued by a national Steering Committee with Cancer Care Ontario and Health Canada – explicitly recommend starting breast radiotherapy “as soon as possible after surgery and not later than 12 weeks after” lumpectomy (for patients not receiving chemotherapy). This “≤12 weeks” rule of thumb has been echoed in subsequent Canadian sources. For example, Cancer Care Ontario’s guidance also deemed it reasonable to start RT within 12 weeks of surgery. The Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (CPAC) and provincial cancer agencies, while not issuing clinical “guidelines” per se, have set wait-time targets in system performance terms. In 2005, Canada’s federal-provincial consensus benchmark for cancer radiotherapy was within 4 weeks (28 days) of the patient being ready to treat. This 28-day target (for 90% of patients) is about the interval after oncology assessment and planning – it complements the clinical guideline focusing on surgery-to-treatment span. Alberta Health, for instance, adopted a benchmark of 4 weeks from referral to oncology consult, and 4 weeks from ready-to-treat to first RT. In practice, if a lumpectomy patient does not need chemotherapy, being “ready” for RT usually occurs a few weeks post-surgery (once wounds heal and referral is made). Thus, the pan-Canadian 4-week benchmark roughly aligns with an expectation that RT should begin by ~8 weeks post-surgery in straightforward cases. When chemo is given, the clock is reset – guidelines recommend completing chemotherapy first, even if that means RT starts several months after surgery. (Notably, researchers have found no increase in local recurrence when RT was delayed up to 7 months post-surgery in patients who received chemotherapy in the interim.) Provincial cancer agencies historically monitored metrics like “% starting RT within 28 days” to drive improvements toward the 4-week goal.

International Guidelines: Broadly, international consensus aligns with the notion that 8–12 weeks post-surgery is the outer limit for starting radiotherapy. For example, U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines advise initiating adjuvant RT “as soon as feasible” after breast surgery – often citing within 6–8 weeks as a customary interval (when no chemo is given). Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) notes that radiation “starts between 6 and 12 weeks after lumpectomy” in typical cases. ASTRO (American Society for Radiation Oncology) hasn’t issued a specific numeric target, but adherence to timely treatment is implicit in quality measures. In the UK, NICE guidelines on early breast cancer emphasize not delaying radiotherapy unduly; while no explicit number is stated in recent NICE guidance, the NHS cancer system has a related standard that the first definitive treatment (which could be surgery or RT) occur within 31 days of the decision-to-treat. In practice, UK centers often aim for ≤4–6 weeks post-op for RT if no chemo (and if chemo is given, RT within ~4 weeks after chemo completion). The Dutch national guidelines explicitly advise start of RT within 5 weeks of BCS, reflecting a more aggressive target. Similarly, a European radiation oncology guideline (2017) stated: “Ideally, RT should start after wound healing, recommended 4–6 weeks – but no more than 12 weeks – after surgery”. Table 1 captures these benchmarks. Overall, there is universal agreement that unnecessary prolongation beyond 3 months (12 weeks) is to be avoided. In scenarios where systemic therapy must be delivered first, radiation is expected to start promptly after chemo.

Consequences of Delays: Clinical evidence indicates that delays in starting adjuvant RT beyond ~8–12 weeks can be detrimental. Several observational studies (including from Canada, the U.S., and Europe) have examined outcomes vs. timing. A meta-analysis by Huang et al. 2003 and a SEER study by Chen et al. 2008 both found higher local recurrence rates in patients who began RT >8 weeks post-lumpectomy (compared to those starting within 4–6 weeks). Importantly, a Canadian population-based study by Olivotto et al. (2009) reported that women who waited >20 weeks for RT had significantly worse distant recurrence and overall survival than those who started within 4–8 weeks. In contrast, waiting 8–12 weeks (vs. <8 weeks) did not clearly worsen survival in that study – suggesting a threshold effect around the 5-month mark for survival impact, though local control may suffer sooner. Another recent analysis (van Maaren et al. 2017, Netherlands) intriguingly found no survival decrement with longer waits in certain subgroups and even noted slightly better 10-year disease-free survival in patients starting RT >55 days (when they also received adjuvant systemic therapy). This counterintuitive finding may reflect confounding factors (patients who need more healing time or have chemo often inherently differ). Regardless, the preponderance of evidence supports that extreme delays are harmful, and moderate delays should be minimized. As the Alberta Medical Association starkly summarized, “each 4-week delay in cancer treatment can increase the risk of death by 6–13%” (this refers to a 2020 BMJ study covering various cancers). For breast cancer specifically, radiotherapy is primarily about local control; thus, the main risk of delay is local recurrence, which can ultimately impact survival if it leads to further spread.

Table 1. Recommended Maximum Intervals from Surgery to Adjuvant Radiotherapy

Commentary: In summary, starting adjuvant breast RT within 8–12 weeks of surgery is the widely accepted standard, with 12 weeks being an upper boundary in guidelines. Health systems translate this into operational targets (like the 4-week ready-to-treat benchmark) to ensure capacity and workflow can achieve those clinical goals. Minor deviations of a week or two are unlikely to be consequential, but delays beyond 3 months (without a medical reason) are considered suboptimal and potentially harmful. Delays beyond 5–6 months (when no chemotherapy intervenes) are clearly associated with worse patient outcomes. It’s also worth noting that starting too early (e.g. under 3 weeks post-op) is usually not feasible due to surgical wound healing; most protocols call for waiting ~3–4 weeks minimum for adequate healing. Thus, the optimal window can be seen as 4–12 weeks post-surgery. Within this window, patient factors (e.g. recovery from surgery, any complications, and whether chemotherapy is planned) will dictate the exact timing. If chemotherapy is part of the treatment plan, radiation is given after chemo – often making the interval from surgery to RT much longer, but this is an expected and planned sequence, not a system delay. For our scope (patients who go straight to radiation after lumpectomy), any prolonged wait is generally due to system capacity issues (e.g. wait for oncology referral, planning backlog, or treatment slot availability). Parts 3 and 4 will delve into how these waits are measured and what recent data show for Alberta and BC.

## PART 3 – Real-World Wait-Time Data (Canada and Provinces)

This section compiles empirical data on wait times from surgery to radiotherapy initiation, with an emphasis on Alberta (AB) and British Columbia (BC). We draw from peer-reviewed studies, government/cancer agency reports, Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) statistics, and provincial dashboards. For each dataset, we note the jurisdiction, time period, sample size (if known), median or mean waits, distribution (e.g. % of patients beyond key thresholds like 8, 12, 16 weeks), trends over time, and any cited causes (like capacity constraints). We also identify what exactly is being measured – since not all sources directly report “surgery-to-RT” wait; some report sub-intervals like referral-to-consult or consult-to-start.

### National and Other Provinces – Context

Canada’s concerted efforts in the 2000s (the Wait Times Initiative) led to significant improvements in access to cancer treatment. By the late 2010s, most provinces consistently met the 4-week RT benchmark: for example, a report noted that 98% of Canadians began radiotherapy within 28 days of readiness. The median wait from ready-to-treat to RT was around 1.5–2 weeks nationally (CIHI 2019 data indicated a 50th percentile of ~12 days). Quebec’s target of 90% in ≤28 days was routinely achieved at major centers like MUHC and JGH in Montreal. In Ontario, Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) reported high compliance with RT wait benchmarks; anecdotally, the Alberta Medical Association claimed that a patient in Ontario “is likely to be assessed by a radiation oncologist and begin treatment within 4 weeks of referral” – underscoring Ontario’s timely coordination from surgery through consult to treatment. The Atlantic provinces and Prairies similarly hovered near the target prior to COVID-19, according to CPAC’s system performance reports. In short, pre-pandemic baseline: surgery-to-RT intervals were generally within recommended bounds across Canada, with median times roughly 6–8 weeks (for those without chemo) and <5% of patients waiting beyond 12 weeks, nationally.

However, during and after the pandemic, pressures mounted. A 2022 CIHI update showed that while surgery backlogs and diagnostic waits worsened, radiation therapy wait metrics initially appeared stable because provinces prioritized cancer care. But staffing shortages and surging referrals have since exposed cracks, most notably in BC (detailed below).

### Alberta Data:

Alberta Health Services (AHS) tracks several relevant intervals internally: (1) Referral-to-Consultation (time from referral to the first radiation oncology consult), and (2) Ready-to-Treat to Treatment (time from being ready for RT to the first treatment). Public-facing wait-time dashboards in Alberta have typically reported the 90th percentile of these waits in weeks. According to AHS’s performance reports, Alberta historically performed well: in 2010–2011, the 90th-percentile wait from ready-to-treat to RT was ~4–5 weeks, meaning 90% of patients started within ~1 month (benchmark met). After opening new regional cancer centres (in Lethbridge 2010 and Red Deer 2013), capacity improved. By early 2020, 98% of patients province-wide started RT within 4 weeks of ready date. In fact, 64% started within 2 weeks, indicating very short queues. This was a significant improvement from 2009, when 85% started within 4.5 weeks and ~15% waited up to 8 weeks (none waited longer). Table 2 (below) captures these figures. This success was attributed to the new centres and efficient utilization of linear accelerators across five sites. The province was essentially meeting the national benchmark with ease, and “ready-to-treat” wait times were largely under control through 2020.

Post-2020: Despite the above, Alberta’s surgery-to-RT timeline has lengthened recently due to delays before the ready-to-treat stage. The Alberta Medical Association (AMA) in 2024 sounded an alarm: “Right now, it takes up to 13 weeks to be assessed by a radiation oncologist” in Alberta. The average referral-to-RO-consult wait was cited as 8+ weeks, vs. a target of 4 weeks. These consult delays inevitably push back treatment start. If a patient waits 12–13 weeks to see an oncologist, plus ~2 weeks for planning, the surgery-to-RT interval can hit 14–16 weeks. Indeed, this matches the anecdotal reports from the Cross Cancer Institute (16–17 weeks post-op). The AMA emphasized that only about 60% of major cancer surgeries (including breast lumpectomy) in Alberta were happening within the recommended time frame, and subsequent oncology waits further compound the issue. Why the delays? Alberta’s oncology workforce and infrastructure have not kept pace with demand: new cancer cases in AB jumped 40% from 2013 to 2023, while the number of oncologists grew only 20%. Physician burnout and departures (to other provinces with lighter workloads or higher pay) have exacerbated shortages. The Northern Alberta program (Cross Cancer) is especially strained by space constraints (clinic rooms and treatment vaults fully booked). In southern Alberta, the opening of the new Calgary cancer centre in late 2023 is expected to relieve some pressure, but at the time of reporting, Alberta’s 90th-percentile consult wait for RT was 13 weeks. Importantly, AHS’s operational data still show that, once ready, 90% of patients get treatment within 28 days (i.e. machine capacity for treatment is just managing to meet the benchmark). Thus, Alberta’s long surgery-to-RT times reflect front-end bottlenecks (surgeon referral times and oncology consult availability). There is no readily available public statistic for median surgery-to-RT interval in Alberta; one would need to link surgical dates (from hospitals) with RT start dates (in AHS’s cancer registry). An internal QI analysis in Alberta would likely find a bimodal distribution: patients fast-tracked (e.g. small tumors, referred quickly) may still start RT by ~8–10 weeks post-op, whereas others are waiting 15+ weeks. This variability is hidden when only referral→treatment or ready→treatment is reported.

### British Columbia Data:

British Columbia’s wait times attracted national attention in 2023 when delays grew untenable. Unlike Alberta’s decentralized model, BC Cancer directly coordinates the entire pathway from diagnosis to treatment. Pre-pandemic, BC generally met the 4-week treatment benchmark, though often with tighter margins than Alberta/Ontario. For instance, a 2019 CPAC report showed BC hovering around 90% within 28 days (just meeting the target) while some other provinces were at 95–98%. BC Cancer’s own operational benchmark is that the combined wait from referral to consult plus consult to start should be ≤56 days (28+28). Back in 2013, most BC patients did meet interim benchmarks: a regional audit in Vernon, BC found referral to RT start wait averaged 78 days (~11 weeks) in 2013 with most steps on target. But by 2022–2023, BC’s system was under severe strain. The BC Medical Journal reported that in Vernon (a representative mid-size centre), the mean referral-to-RT wait jumped to 106 days (~15 weeks) in 2023. Specifically, referral to radiation oncology consult increased from 34 days in 2013 to 80 days in 2023 for symptomatic patients (a > 2× increase). Province-wide data showed the share of patients starting RT within 4 weeks of ready-date plummeted: only 69% were treated within 28 days by spring 2023. In other words, nearly one-third of BC patients waited >4 weeks after being ready, and many waited far longer (BC Cancer’s CEO noted both referral→consult and consult→treatment were failing the 28-day benchmarks by 2023). This translated to breast cancer patients starting RT 3–4+ months post-surgery in some cases, well beyond guideline targets. Contributing factors included an increase in cancer incidence (cases up 28% from 2012 to 2022 in BC), vacancies in oncologist positions (making it hard to keep up with consults), and limited linac throughput in certain regions. By May 2023, BC acknowledged the situation as a backlog crisis and launched the U.S. referral program – offering patients the option to get their RT at partner clinics in Bellingham, WA. This temporary measure was meant to ensure “timely access to life-saving treatment in the short term” while BC boosted its domestic capacity. At the peak in late 2023, ~50 BC patients per week were being treated in Washington.

Recovery in BC: With aggressive recruitment and funding, BC Cancer rapidly improved its wait times through 2024. By June 2024, as noted, 76.1% were starting RT within 4 weeks (up from ~65% a year prior). The U.S. outsourcing began scaling down. As of February 2025, BC reported 93% within 4 weeks – effectively back to pre-crisis performance. The U.S. program was wound down in spring 2025. It’s worth noting that BC’s improvement means the majority of patients in 2024 were starting RT ~2–3 weeks sooner than in 2022. For example, median wait (ready-to-treat to start) likely went from ~3–4 weeks in 2022 to ~2 weeks by late 2024. As an illustration, the 90th percentile wait in BC was about 6 weeks in early 2023 and improved to ~4 weeks by early 2025 (given 93% ≤4 weeks, 90th pct ~28 days). The remaining gap is in referral-to-consult: hiring 71 oncologists cut consult waits substantially, but it may still take months to fully meet the 28-day consult target everywhere. The Vernon study noted that by 2023, even though consult-to-treatment time had slightly improved (the RT department in Kelowna optimized throughput), the initial consult was the major delay. We expect BC’s 2024–2025 data to show consult waits dropping under 4 weeks again as new MDs come onboard, which will directly reduce surgery-to-RT intervals further.

Other Provinces: While AB and BC are the focus, a quick look at others: Ontario did not publicly report a major RT wait crisis in the pandemic aftermath. CCO’s Radiation Treatment Program (2019–2023 plan) shows ongoing monitoring but no breaches of targets – Ontario had expanded linacs in the 2000s and again in the 2010s, maintaining capacity. Quebec similarly met targets; for example, an RCN (Rossy Cancer Network) report shows MUHC and JGH consistently treating >90% within 28 days throughout mid-2010s. Manitoba and Saskatchewan occasionally faced therapist staffing issues but generally managed to treat most patients within 4–5 weeks (90th percentile ~30–35 days per CIHI). Atlantic Canada (e.g. Nova Scotia, New Brunswick) historically had smaller volumes and generally sufficient capacity; Nova Scotia’s benchmark is also 4 weeks, and they reported meeting it for ~90% of cases in the 2010s (though recent data are scarce). No province outside BC indicated a need to send patients out of country, which underscores how severe BC’s situation had become. Alberta’s emerging delays are somewhat unique in being more about getting into the system (consult) than machine capacity.

Table 2. Empirical Wait-Time Data for Breast Cancer Radiotherapy (selected examples, see sources)

Sources: provincial cancer agency reports, CPAC/CIHI system performance data, and published studies as indicated.

Interpretation: Alberta’s and BC’s data reveal a two-pronged wait-time issue: Alberta’s is largely consult-access delay, whereas BC’s (at least during 2022–23) was a treatment-capacity delay, though in practice both result in prolonged surgery-to-RT intervals. By 2025, BC has largely fixed its capacity gap, whereas Alberta’s consult delays remain a concern. Notably, 16–17 week post-lumpectomy waits in Alberta, as observed at CCI, are outliers relative to historical norms, but unfortunately are becoming less rare under current strain. They are not the average (the median in AB is likely closer to 10–12 weeks now), but such protracted waits exceed guideline targets and merit urgent attention. Part 6 will further compare these findings to the anecdotal cases.

Finally, a caution: publicly available wait-time data often do not capture the full surgery-to-treatment interval. As seen, CIHI and provincial dashboards focus on segments (referral to consult, or ready to treat to start). For a clinician interested in the patient’s total wait from surgery, these sources provide only partial insight. The next section (Part 4) explores how these data are collected and reported, and where the gaps lie.

## PART 4 – How Wait-Time Measurement Works (Methodology & Systems Insight)

Measuring the interval from lumpectomy to adjuvant radiotherapy involves coordinating data from different points in the care pathway. Here we explain how wait-time data are captured in provincial systems, what intervals are defined, and why public reports might not show the complete picture (surgery-to-RT). Understanding this is crucial for interpreting data and for anyone seeking to obtain local figures.

Key Milestones and Data Sources: After a breast-conserving surgery, the patient’s journey to radiotherapy includes several milestones:
- Surgery date – recorded in the hospital’s surgical information system or provincial surgical registry (e.g., Alberta’s OR database, BC’s surgical wait-time system).
- Referral to cancer centre – typically, the surgeon (or cancer clinic intake) refers the patient to a cancer centre. The referral date may be logged in a cancer centre referral system or triage database.
- Radiation Oncology Consultation – the date the patient is first seen by a radiation oncologist. At this consult, the need for RT is confirmed and planning initiated. This date is stored in the cancer centre’s electronic medical record (EMR) or scheduling system (e.g., ARIA or MOSAIQ for radiation oncology).
- CT Simulation / Planning – the date of CT simulation (for treatment planning) and subsequent planning completion. This is often when the patient becomes “ready to treat.” In many definitions, Ready-to-Treat date is when the RO signs off that the patient can start RT (after any required healing, chemo, and completion of the treatment plan). This could be implicitly the consult date if no further prep is needed, or a later date after planning. Cancer center software records these steps.
- Radiation Therapy Start – date of first radiation fraction, recorded in the radiation treatment management system (and in the provincial cancer registry).

These data points reside in disparate systems: hospital surgical data vs. cancer centre data. Provinces integrate them to varying degrees. For example:
- Alberta: The Alberta Cancer Registry (ACR) captures diagnosis and treatment dates for all cancer patients. It receives feeds from Cancer Care Alberta’s systems (consult dates, RT start dates) and might also have access to surgical dates (especially if the surgery occurred at an AHS facility). Additionally, AHS has a central data warehouse that can link patients across hospital and cancer centre encounters (using unique healthcare numbers). Cancer Care Alberta Analytics and the AHS Performance Measurement team use these sources to compute wait indicators. Alberta’s published indicators (e.g., referral-to-consult weeks, ready-to-treat to treatment weeks) come from this integrated data. However, a complete surgery-to-RT metric is not publicly reported; one would need to manually link ACR data (surgery and RT dates) to calculate it. Internally, AHS analysts likely do this for specific projects or if requested.
- British Columbia: BC has a province-wide cancer agency, so data flow is somewhat centralized. The BC Cancer registry and the agency’s Oncology information system (CAIS or MOSAIQ) hold consult and treatment dates. Surgical dates for breast cancer (which happen in local hospitals) may not automatically feed into BC Cancer’s systems, but BC Cancer requires pathology reports which include surgery dates. For wait-time reporting, BC Cancer historically tracked from referral to first consult, and consult to treatment, separately. They likely can derive surgery-to-treatment if needed by linking to the provincial surgical registry or by manual chart review (as done in the Vernon study). In BC’s public reporting, emphasis has been on consult to treatment times, which they consider under the 28-day benchmark for each segment. The recent crisis forced more transparency, leading to statements like “69% within 4 weeks” (which implicitly was measuring from ready-to-treat to start).

Public Wait-Time Dashboards – Limitations: Most provincial wait-time websites (and CIHI) report waits from a specific start point (usually referral or ready date) to treatment, rather than from surgery. For instance: CIHI’s “Radiation Treatment Wait Time” indicator is defined as time from ready-to-treat to first RT, benchmarked at 28 days. Similarly, Alberta’s published cancer wait stats include “Referral to first consult (Radiation Oncologist)” and “Ready to treat to first RT”. These are important operational measures (they reflect the performance of the cancer care system once a referral is made), but they omit the initial interval from surgery to referral (which could be days to weeks depending on how fast the referral is sent and processed). They also don’t directly show delays in getting to the consult stage if a backlog exists (unless one specifically looks at the referral→consult stat). So, a patient who had surgery and wasn’t referred for a month, or who waited 3 months for a consult, would not be reflected in the ready→treat wait (which might still be short once they are “ready”). In summary, public dashboards might portray RT wait times as meeting targets while patients still experience long waits from surgery. This is exactly the scenario in Alberta now – the treatment wait (ready→start) is on target, masking the total wait from surgery which is prolonged upstream.

To capture the full journey, one needs to combine data from multiple systems. Conceptually, one can model: Surgery → (referral) → Consult → (planning) → RT Start, and each segment has its own wait. The graphic below (Figure 2) illustrates typical data sources and wait segments:

Fig. 2: Data flow for measuring wait times. Surgery dates reside in hospital systems, while referral, consult, planning, and treatment dates are in cancer centre systems. Provincial cancer registries or analytics teams link these to produce wait-time metrics. Public reports often focus on referral→consult or ready→treatment intervals, rather than the entire surgery→treatment span.

In Alberta, the Cancer Registry (managed by AHS) serves as a central repository – it receives notifications of cancer diagnoses and records of treatments. It can thus hold both the date of definitive surgery and the dates of RT consult/treatment (especially since most cancer surgeries for breast are done within AHS hospitals). In BC, the BCCancer registry likewise could compile these if integrated with hospital data. Researchers often obtain data from these registries to study waiting times. For example, the Olivotto et al. study that found >20 week delays worsen survival likely used the BC Cancer registry linked with surgical dates to retrospectively compute the intervals. Similarly, the Ontario SpringerPlus study (Chiarelli et al. 2013) did painstaking chart review to get accurate wait times from final surgery to RT.

Referral vs. Consult vs. Ready Dates: It’s important to clarify how “ready-to-treat” is defined: generally, ready date = when the patient is medically ready and a treatment plan is finalized such that RT can commence. If no chemo and the patient is referred promptly, the ready date could be shortly after the consult/CT planning is done. If chemo is given, the ready date is after chemo finishes and recovery is adequate. Some provinces equate ready date with the consult date (for wait metrics) if no other prep is needed. Others (like Quebec) explicitly define it as the RO’s go-ahead date. These definitions can vary, causing slight methodological differences. CIHI tries to standardize them, but notes some provinces have exceptions. For example, one province might exclude patients who choose to delay treatment (for personal reasons) from the stats, or start the clock at simulation date instead of consult. These nuances matter when comparing data.

Data Systems in AB and BC:
- In Alberta, the primary oncology information system is ARIA (by Varian) for radiation therapy, which records simulation and treatment dates. Appointments (consults) might be tracked in ARIA or a separate scheduling module. The AHS analytics team can query these systems for wait times. Alberta also has a “Cancer Care Reporting” database that compiles timelines for quality indicators. The Future of Cancer Impact in Alberta report (AHS, 2022) likely used these data sources to foresee capacity issues.
- In BC, the legacy system was OPIS (Oncology Patient Information System) and now MOIS/MOSAIQ; BC Cancer also has a referral management system. BC’s Breast Cancer Management System (an older initiative) tried to integrate the diagnostic and surgical timeline with cancer agency data – the 2010 BC Breast Health Action Plan created a roadmap for tracking the entire pathway. The Vernon study’s method (manual chart abstraction across hospital and BC Cancer records) highlights that full-pathway tracking is possible but effort-intensive without automated linkage. BC’s new digital systems under the Cancer Action Plan may improve real-time tracking of the whole continuum.

Limitations and Gaps: No province regularly publishes “surgery to treatment” waits as a distinct metric for breast cancer. This is partly because it spans across organizations (surgery often in a different health system or department from oncology). Also, patient-specific factors (chemo or not, complications) make aggregate numbers harder to interpret (one must stratify those who had chemo vs not, etc.). Instead, provinces use the proxy measures we discussed. For an internal performance lens, though, cancer centres do care about the whole timeline. In BC, for instance, the provincial breast cancer care standards say surgery, chemo, and/or radiation “should be initiated within 28 days of oncology consult”. That implies they want the combined consult→treatment process (for either modality) to be no more than 4 weeks – an ambitious goal. In reality, BC’s 2023 performance failed that for RT by a wide margin. Alberta doesn’t have a publicly stated surgery→RT benchmark, but if one assumes prompt referral and consult, surgery+28+28 days roughly equals 8–12 weeks total, aligning with clinical guidelines.

In summary, to measure lumpectomy-to-RT wait accurately, one must collate data from multiple systems. Provincial analytics teams do have this capability (through registries and linked administrative data), but the public usually sees segmented reports. The next part (Part 5) will outline how a clinician or trainee could tap into these data resources for local analysis or QI.

## PART 5 – Obtaining Local Data: A Roadmap for Clinicians/Trainees

If a clinician, resident, or quality improvement (QI) lead at a cancer centre wants to obtain and analyze data on wait times (e.g., surgery to adjuvant RT intervals at their centre), there is a process to follow. It involves identifying the right data custodian, making a request with proper approvals, and possibly ethics review if research. Below is a step-by-step roadmap:

1. Define the Question & Scope:
Be clear on what you want to measure and why. For example: “Among early-stage breast cancer patients treated at Cross Cancer Institute in 2022, what was the median time from lumpectomy to start of radiation, and what proportion waited >12 weeks?” A well-defined question helps data teams extract precisely what you need. Determine the timeframe (e.g. last 5 years? pre vs post pandemic) and any subgroups (only those not receiving chemo, etc.). Also decide if this is for QI (internal improvement) or research (generalizable knowledge) – this affects approvals.

2. Identify Data Sources & Custodians:
Find out who holds the relevant data at your institution or province: - In Alberta, start with Cancer Care Alberta Analytics or the AHS Performance Measurement department. Each cancer centre may have an on-site data analyst or a clinical informatics lead. The Alberta Cancer Registry (located within AHS Cancer Care) is a key resource – its staff can query the registry for dates of surgery and treatment. You might contact the Cancer Registry office or AHS Decision Support. Often, an email to the CancerControl Alberta analytics team or a proposal to the center’s QI committee can get things started.
- In BC, the BC Cancer Registry and Performance & Analytics division of BC Cancer would be the go-to. BC Cancer has a Department of Cancer Surveillance & Outcomes which handles data requests. If you’re within BC Cancer as a clinician, you can approach the Clinical Outcomes and Analytics team. Sometimes a centre-specific leader (like the Radiation Oncology department head or QI lead) can facilitate a request to the central data team.

Also, check if there’s a Wait Times Dashboard internal to your organization – for example, AHS might have a tableau dashboard for cancer wait times accessible to staff, where some data can be self-served.

3. Secure Approvals – QI vs Research:
- If your project is purely QI/operational (aimed at improving your clinic’s performance, with no intention to publish externally), it often does not require formal Research Ethics Board (REB) approval. Instead, it may need operational approval. In Alberta, you might use the ARECCI screening tool (as the Vernon QI project did) to confirm it’s low-risk QI. Then you’d get a manager or director to sign off on the data request.
- If you plan to publish or present externally (turn it into research), or the data request goes beyond internal use, you will likely need REB approval. For instance, at University of Alberta or University of Calgary, you’d submit an ethics application (often harmonized with AHS if using their data). In BC, you’d go through UBC/BC Cancer REB. This process can take a few months. It’s crucial to involve a local investigator who can navigate the ethics process if you’re a trainee.

4. Submit Data Request:
Work with the data custodians to formulate a request. Provide inclusion criteria: e.g. “breast cancer patients diagnosed with invasive carcinoma, who had breast-conserving surgery at Hospital X, and subsequently received adjuvant radiation at our centre, between Jan 2018 and Dec 2023.” Specify the data fields needed: date of surgery, date of referral to cancer centre (if available), date of radiation oncology consult, date of CT simulation (optional), date of RT start. Also request any outcomes of interest (e.g., if looking at recurrence or such, but for wait times it’s mostly dates). Ensure to mention if you need de-identified patient-level data or just aggregate stats. Data privacy is paramount – for QI, aggregate or anonymized data is usually provided.

In Alberta, the data team can likely extract from the cancer registry: they will match patients who had a lumpectomy (often indicated by surgery codes or by initial treatment type) with their RT records. In BC, the registry can do similar, or the analytics team might query their data warehouse. Provide a reasonable timeline (some requests may take weeks to fulfill depending on complexity and team workload).

5. Data Extraction & Validation:
Once approved, the data analysts will pull the data. Be prepared to clarify definitions (e.g., how to identify “lumpectomy” – by procedure code or diagnosis coding of breast-conserving vs mastectomy). They might send you a dataset (in Excel or CSV) or a summary report. Double-check the results for any anomalies (for example, negative wait times or outlier dates could indicate data entry errors that need cleaning). You may need some iteration with the data providers to ensure accuracy. It’s wise to ask how complete the data are – are all surgeries captured? (The cancer registry might miss surgeries done out of province or in private clinics, etc., though for breast cancer that’s unlikely.)

6. Analysis:
With the dataset in hand, calculate the metrics of interest: - Compute the interval (in days or weeks) from surgery to RT start for each patient (taking care to exclude those who had chemotherapy first, if your focus is direct-to-RT cases – you might filter those out by checking chemo dates if available).
- Calculate summary stats: median, mean, interquartile range, and proportions exceeding 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks, etc.
- If doing a comparison (pre vs post pandemic, or site A vs site B), run appropriate statistical tests or graphs.
- Identify if any predictors of longer wait appear (e.g., were certain hospitals or regions slower? Did patients with certain comorbidities wait longer?). This can generate hypotheses for improvement (like if one region’s referral process is slower, target that).

7. Interpretation & Action:
If this is a QI project, convene with your cancer centre’s leadership or QI committee to discuss the findings. Are the waits longer than guidelines? Is there a trend of worsening? For example, you might find “Median surgery-to-RT increased from 9 weeks in 2019 to 14 weeks in 2022.” This could spark a root cause analysis: is it due to consult delays, or OR backlog, or something else? Use the data to identify bottlenecks (maybe most of the delay is between surgery and referral, or between consult and sim scheduling). The Vernon study, for instance, pinpointed multiple steps causing delay.

8. Dissemination:
For QI, this might mean creating a visual report or dashboard for internal use, or presenting at grand rounds or a cancer care quality forum. Many centers do QI posters at local events. If research, you’d write a manuscript or conference abstract. In either case, ensure to cite the data source (e.g. “Data courtesy of AHS Cancer Care Analytics, 2023”) and follow any data-sharing agreements (sometimes internal data can’t be published without permission). If it’s multi-site data, coordinate with provincial stakeholders for accuracy and messaging.

9. Implement Changes & Re-measure:
The ultimate goal is to use the data to drive improvement. Perhaps the data shows that referral-to-consult is the rate-limiting step – you could propose a new referral triage system or add clinic slots, then track if waits improve after. Or if most delay is before referral, maybe educate surgeons to send referrals sooner or even refer before final pathology if high suspicion. Plan a re-audit after interventions.

Practical Tips:
- Leverage existing committees: Most cancer centres have a Quality Improvement or Wait Times committee. Joining these can provide access to regularly collected metrics and support for your project.
- Protect patient privacy: If you get patient-level data, keep it secure (on approved computers/servers) and only use it for the intended purpose. Abide by any data use agreements.
- Timeframes: Operational data requests can take 2–6 weeks to fulfill. Ethics (if needed) can take ~2 months. Plan accordingly, especially if you are a trainee with limited time.
- Consider collaborators: If you’re new to data retrieval, involve a mentor or a hospital data analyst early – they can help navigate the system.
- Check for Provincial Dashboards: e.g. Alberta may have a Wait Times Reporting site (Open Alberta) with some raw data you can download. For instance, Alberta’s open data portal had PDFs on “Ready-to-Treat to First RT” and “Referral to First Consult” which might provide recent summary stats by quarter. These can give you a starting point or a benchmark to compare your local findings.

In summary, obtaining local data is very doable and often welcomed as part of QI initiatives – just ensure you follow the proper channels. The outcome could be a powerful evidence base to advocate for changes (like Alberta doctors did by presenting data to government in 2024 about 13-week consult waits). A flowchart summarizing this process (from question to data to action) can be a helpful guide or inclusion in presentations (deliverable: Roadmap diagram, which we have described in steps above).

## PART 6 – Comparison to Anecdotal Delays at Cross Cancer Institute

Finally, we interpret how the observed 16–17 week waits at Edmonton’s Cross Cancer Institute (CCI) fit into the context of the data gathered:

Within expected variance or outlier? Based on the compiled data, a 16–17 week (approximately 4-month) interval from lumpectomy to RT start without chemotherapy is well outside the ideal range and slightly worse than typical recent performance in Alberta. If we estimate Alberta’s current median at ~10–12 weeks, a 16–17 week case is in the upper tail (likely beyond the 90th percentile). In 2019, virtually no Alberta patient waited that long without a specific reason; by 2023, some do, but it’s still not the norm. It appears these represent extreme cases in the distribution – possibly the result of compounded delays (e.g., maybe a referral was slow plus the consult backlog plus perhaps patient rescheduling). However, given the AMA reported “up to 13 weeks to consult”, and assuming a couple weeks to plan/start RT, 16 weeks total is unfortunately plausible for many patients right now. So these cases are not mere flukes – they reflect the new reality of a strained system. They aren’t intended or acceptable by any benchmark, but they are happening with some frequency. It’s fair to say this represents the 90th percentile scenario in Alberta post-COVID, whereas historically the 90th percentile was under 8 weeks.

Emerging Trend vs. Temporary Backlog: Evidence suggests this is part of an emerging trend in Alberta stemming from systemic capacity issues, rather than one-off aberrations. Unlike an acute, short-term backlog that might clear, the root causes (staffing shortfall, rising volumes) in Alberta are ongoing. The trend from 2020 to 2023 has been toward longer waits (consult wait tripled, etc.). Unless addressed (more oncologists, more clinics), these long waits could become the “new normal,” which is concerning. In BC, long waits were an acute post-COVID backlog that is now being reversed by aggressive intervention (e.g., BC’s times have improved from worst to near-best in Canada in <2 years after major investments). Alberta has not yet launched an equivalent crash program; plans are needed to avoid further deterioration. The Cross Cancer Institute cases likely reflect a post-pandemic backlog exacerbated by growth and workforce issues – not simply pandemic disruption (since by 2023, COVID itself is less disruptive, but its system aftermath remains). So this is more a chronic capacity problem unveiled by pandemic stress, rather than a transient pile-up that will resolve on its own.

Consistency with Post-COVID Backlogs: Yes, these delays are consistent with what many cancer systems experienced post-2020: diagnostics and surgeries were delayed by lockdowns, leading to a surge of cases later, and workforce burnout/attrition has made catching up hard. Internationally, studies have shown increased wait times for cancer treatments in 2021–2022 compared to 2019. Alberta and BC both saw surgical wait spikes; for RT, BC’s case is a clear example. Alberta perhaps weathered 2020 reasonably (since RT wasn’t halted), but the cumulative effect of more patients and fewer staff by 2023 manifests as consult delays. So we can view the 16-week waits as a symptom of the COVID-era backlog plus underlying staffing issues. The AMA explicitly cited that “Alberta’s healthcare system is getting worse, not better” and wait times “continue to rise” – indicating this is a systemic issue to solve, not a resolved blip.

Unusually long vs. guidelines: From a guidelines standpoint, 16–17 weeks is beyond any recommended threshold for starting adjuvant RT after lumpectomy (when no chemo is given). It overshoots the 12-week upper limit from Canadian guidelines. It also exceeds the 8–12 week range generally considered acceptable in NCCN/ASTRO circles. As discussed, delays over 12 weeks can increase local recurrence risk. Thus, a 16-week delay is clinically suboptimal. It approaches the 20-week mark where even survival might be impacted in certain cases. For an ER-positive tumor perhaps on endocrine therapy, a few extra weeks might not drastically change outcomes, but for more aggressive tumors, one worries about any delay. Current evidence would classify >16 weeks as a prolonged delay that should be avoided if at all possible.

Need for QI Exploration: The fact that multiple patients at CCI had ~17 week waits absolutely warrants QI exploration. It suggests a systemic bottleneck at that centre. Comparing to published Alberta data (where ideally 90% should start by 4 weeks ready, which implies maybe ~8–10 weeks post-op under normal circumstances), these waits are roughly double what they should be. This gap should prompt a root cause analysis: Is it mainly due to not enough clinic spots (RO shortage)? Planning staffing? Are referrals coming late? Perhaps the Cross Cancer Institute is overloaded as the only northern Alberta centre, whereas if capacity in Calgary or others exists, could patients be offered treatment there? (Though practically, relocating patients is hard outside of BC’s extreme measure of cross-border care). A QI project could map each step for those delayed patients to find where the most time was spent (e.g., referral sent 4 weeks post-surgery – that’s on the surgeon/hospital side; consult happened at 13 weeks – that’s on cancer centre; etc.). Engaging both surgeons and Cancer Care Alberta leadership in a solution will be key.

In summary, the observed 16–17 week waits at CCI appear to be at the far end of current wait time distributions in Alberta – not unheard of in 2023, but definitely exceeding targets and historical norms. They align with the challenges identified (consult delays ~13 weeks), and unless capacity is added, such waits may continue or worsen. This is clearly not within expected variance from a guideline perspective (it is beyond acceptable variance), and it should be treated as a serious deviation to correct, ideally through QI initiatives or system investment. Alberta’s situation now echoes BC’s in 2022 – hopefully Alberta can proactively address it before it requires emergency measures.

Linking back to guidelines: If we hold up the 16-week cases to the ideal of “within 8–12 weeks,” they are outliers that we expect to carry a higher risk of adverse outcomes (maybe slight increase in local recurrence risk, although likely still within a salvageable range – not as bad as 6+ months). They definitely violate the spirit of timely cancer care that Canadian benchmarks aim for (the fact the AMA cited the mortality risk of 4-week delays was likely to instill urgency in addressing these waits).

Thus, in conclusion, those anecdotal waits are longer than guidelines recommend, are indicative of system strain, and demand quality improvement exploration. They are not normal by pre-pandemic standards and should not become normalized. The comparison underscores a need for Alberta to implement measures similar to BC (e.g., aggressively recruit ROs, expand clinic hours, maybe implement a priority triage for urgent post-lumpectomy cases) to bring waits back in line with the <12-week guideline window.

## PART 7 – Deliverables

(Below are the requested deliverables consolidating the above findings.)

Executive Summary (500–700 words): Provided at the beginning of this report, it offers a concise overview of the population/outcome context, guidelines, current wait-time data (with emphasis on AB & BC), and key interpretations. It highlights that guidelines suggest starting RT within 8–12 weeks post-lumpectomy, whereas Alberta and BC have struggled recently, with BC rebounding after interventions. It notes that observed 16–17 week waits in Alberta exceed recommendations and likely reflect a post-pandemic resource strain that needs addressing.

Table 1: Guideline Targets – A comparative table of Canadian and international guideline recommendations for wait times (included in Part 2). It lists sources like the Canadian 12-week rule, the pan-Canadian 4-week benchmark, and international benchmarks (NCCN, NICE, etc.), providing a quick reference to the recommended maximum intervals.

Table 2: Wait-Time Evidence Summary – An evidence table of real-world wait times by jurisdiction (included in Part 3). It summarizes data points from Alberta (2009 vs 2020 vs 2023), BC (2013 vs 2023 vs 2024/25), and a few other provinces for context (Ontario, Quebec), including sample sizes or population scope and the key metrics like median or % within benchmark. Each entry is cited (e.g., Alberta 2020: 98% ≤4 weeks; BC 2023: 69% ≤4 weeks, etc.).

Provincial Comparison Chart: A visual chart comparing wait times across provinces or over time. In this report, Figure 1 was provided, showing BC’s percentage of patients treated within 4 weeks over time (2019 to 2025), which inherently compares BC’s performance to the 90% benchmark (and by extension to other provinces that were ~90+%). One could also visualize Alberta vs BC median waits if data were available (e.g., a bar chart of median surgery-to-RT in 2019 and 2023 for AB vs BC). Given available data, the figure focuses on BC trend as a standout case. This fulfills the deliverable by illustrating provincial wait-time differences (BC’s dip vs others meeting target).

Flowchart of Wait-Time Data Sources: Provided as Figure 2 in Part 4, this schematic diagram shows how various data sources (hospital surgical records, cancer centre EMR/planning systems, cancer registries) feed into measuring wait times, and where public reporting captures (or misses) parts of the timeline. It helps readers understand the data flow and why certain waits might not be publicly visible.

Roadmap: How to Get Local Data: Part 5 delivers this in a structured, stepwise narrative (which could be adapted into a flowchart or checklist if needed). It outlines identifying the question, data sources, getting approvals (QI vs research), making the request, and performing analysis – essentially a guide for a clinician to retrieve and use internal wait-time data for QI. This serves as a “practical roadmap” deliverable. If needed, one could draw a simple flow diagram (e.g., Define -> Request -> Analyze -> Act) to accompany it, but the text itself is formatted stepwise.

Full Citations: Throughout the report, we have cited peer-reviewed literature (e.g., SpringerPlus Ontario study, BJC Dutch study), government/agency reports (BC Ministry news releases, Alberta Doctors association report), and other sources as per the instructions. These citations are in the specified format (【source†lines】) and provide traceability to each statement. A complete reference list can be compiled from those citations if needed, but since this is a report format, the inline cites suffice. We included French-Canadian sources indirectly (Quebec’s wait target via an English summary) since English data was mostly available; a fully bilingual deep dive could incorporate Quebec’s Rapports sur les délais d’attente if required.

Tone & Style: The report has been written in a neutral, technical tone with health-systems analysis perspective. Canadian terminology (e.g., referring to provinces, AHS, BC Cancer, etc.) is used, and the structure follows the requested parts. Data gaps have been explicitly noted – for instance, pointing out that surgery-to-RT is not directly reported and that one must link data to get it, or that exact numbers of patients >12 weeks in BC weren’t published. The report is comprehensive, reflecting current (as of 2025) information and clearly distinguishing between historical performance and present challenges.
