Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming multiple areas of medicine, but radiation oncology stands out as one of the specialties most primed for meaningful, practical gains in the next 5–10 years. This is largely because the field is deeply dependent on medical imaging, highly protocol-driven, and filled with repetitive digital tasks. These characteristics make radiation oncology an ideal candidate for workflow automation and decision-support tools that enhance efficiency while maintaining high clinical standards.

Among the most immediate and visible changes is the role of AI in **contouring and image segmentation**. Manual delineation of organs-at-risk (OARs) and target volumes has long been one of the most time-consuming and variable components of the treatment planning process. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled tools that can generate high-quality contours within minutes. Multiple studies over the past few years have demonstrated that auto-segmentation can reduce contouring time by 50–80% while achieving geometric accuracy comparable to expert clinicians. For example, in a Mayo Clinic study evaluating deep learning models for head and neck auto-segmentation, AI-generated contours required minimal or minor edits in 90% of cases, reducing contouring time by approximately 76% (Patel et al., 2023). Importantly, the variability between clinicians was also significantly reduced, offering not just speed but improved consistency.

The impact of this technology is already being felt internationally. In 2023, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) conducted an Early Value Assessment for nine commercial AI auto-contouring tools and concluded that they produce contours of comparable quality to manual ones, often requiring only small adjustments, and could therefore be safely adopted with clinician oversight (NICE, 2023). The NHS projected that even modest time savings of 5–10 minutes per plan would scale to thousands of staff-hours saved annually across the country—and in reality, many centres report that savings are significantly greater for complex sites like head and neck or pelvis.

AI is also transforming **treatment planning**, historically one of the most labour-intensive parts of the radiation therapy workflow. Knowledge-based planning (KBP) and deep learning–driven optimization tools can now generate high-quality IMRT or VMAT plans in minutes rather than hours or days. These systems learn from large datasets of prior high-quality plans and use that knowledge to produce consistent, protocol-adherent plans with minimal human modification. For example, RayStation’s AI-driven autoplanning and Varian’s Ethos platform demonstrate that automated planning can reliably produce clinically acceptable plans with reduced need for iterative adjustments. A recurring theme in early implementations is that AI reduces the dependency on individual planner skill or experience, thereby standardizing plan quality and reducing unwarranted variation.

Perhaps the most profound advancement AI enables is the expansion of **adaptive radiotherapy (ART)**. In traditional adaptive workflows, the need for re-contouring and re-planning mid-course has made the process too time-consuming for routine daily use. However, AI-powered platforms—most notably Varian’s Ethos—automatically generate new contours, re-optimize the plan, and perform QA checks within a standard 15–20 minute appointment slot. Multi-institution reports from 2023 onward have shown that daily adaptive radiotherapy is clinically feasible across several disease sites without extending treatment times (Barragán Montero et al., 2023). As a result, ART is poised to become a mainstream tool rather than a niche offering reserved for highly specialized centres.

Beyond contouring and planning, AI is increasingly used in **quality assurance (QA)**. Machine learning models can predict whether a plan is likely to pass gamma analysis or whether certain beam configurations may pose issues before physical measurements are performed. Some models analyze MLC performance patterns and predict when maintenance might be needed—effectively creating a predictive maintenance layer atop standard machine QA. Others automate chart checks by verifying adherence to protocol-specified constraints. These innovations can save 20–30 minutes per patient-specific QA review, a substantial efficiency gain in high-volume centres.

AI is also expanding into **clinical decision support**, offering clinicians improved methods of analyzing imaging, predicting toxicities, and estimating treatment response. Radiomics-based models are increasingly capable of extracting meaningful biological signatures from CT, MRI, and PET images. These models can identify tumour subregions at higher risk of recurrence, forecast which patients are most likely to benefit from dose escalation, or predict risks such as xerostomia, pneumonitis, or fibrosis based on baseline imaging and clinical features. While these tools are not a replacement for clinician judgment, they enhance clinical insight and allow more personalized treatment decisions.

Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to influence workflow as well. Early oncology-specific LLMs assist with documenting consultations, summarizing outside records, triaging patient messages, and supporting administrative tasks. While early in their maturity, these tools offer the potential to reduce cognitive load and streamline documentation.

Despite the promise, integrating AI into the clinical workflow remains a significant challenge. Radiation oncology departments must carefully consider how and where AI tools fit—what should be automated, where human oversight is needed, and how to maintain safety in increasingly automated workflows. Discussions at the ESTRO 2023 Physics Workshop emphasized the importance of defining the “optimal point of human intervention” in a semi-automated pipeline. Initially, many clinicians felt they needed to oversee each intermediate step. However, as examples of fully automated scan-to-plan pipelines were demonstrated, participants increasingly recognized that too much human intervention can ironically reduce efficiency without improving quality (Simões, ESTRO News, 2023). The emerging consensus is that clinicians should validate final outputs while allowing AI to manage intermediate processes unless uncertainty or errors are detected.

There are also essential considerations regarding validation, regulation, and liability. AI models require rigorous commissioning akin to any other clinical software. Professional societies such as AAPM have stressed the need for comprehensive validation guidelines before clinical deployment, especially as AI systems continue to evolve. Regulations are also shifting to accommodate the reality that many AI models are continuously learning, raising questions about how often revalidation is required and who bears responsibility when errors occur.

Yet despite these challenges, early adopters demonstrate that the efficiency gains are substantial. Across a typical department, routinely using AI for auto-segmentation alone can save hundreds to thousands of clinician hours per year. When combined with automated planning, adaptive therapy, and QA tools, AI has the potential to radically shorten the simulation-to-treatment timeline, improve throughput, and reduce burnout among radiation oncologists, physicists, and dosimetrists.

Looking 5–10 years ahead, it is likely that AI will become deeply embedded in all stages of the radiation oncology workflow. Most OAR and standard target contours will likely be auto-generated, with clinicians focusing their effort on complex or ambiguous regions. Routine plans may be almost entirely auto-generated on first pass, with planners fine-tuning only as needed. Daily adaptive planning will expand across multiple disease sites, driven by rapid AI-enabled re-contouring and optimization. QA systems will become increasingly predictive and automated. Radiomics-guided decision support will shape treatment personalization more deeply. And LLMs will support clinicians in documentation and administrative tasks, further freeing time for direct patient care.

Importantly, AI is unlikely to replace radiation oncologists or physicists. Instead, it will augment their expertise, enabling them to focus on high-level clinical decision-making, complex adaptive workflows, compassionate communication, and interdisciplinary coordination. In other words, AI will not diminish the specialty—it will elevate it, reshaping workflow in a way that allows clinicians to deliver more precise, personalized, and efficient care.
